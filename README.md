*Minecraft Java Edition is £17.95. While there is a free trial available, this wouldn't meet the requirements for the above. Minecraft Education Edition cannot be used for this project, as it's based on the Bedrock Edition.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16044916/136184541-40bf867f-de4e-4930-bac9-d2c6b55b29c3.png)
